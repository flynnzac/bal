- Manage accounts and keep track of spending using an interactive program to
  enter transactions

- Extensible with Guile Scheme, the program's prompt is a full Scheme
  interpreter (except that you do not have to type parenthesis around the whole
  statement).  The basic commands of the program are Scheme functions themselves
  made interactive so that you can enter their arguments interactively by the
  (leas/call) function.

- See current and future spending to help make plans.  Can change what the
  "current day" of the system is interactively so that you can see both present
  and future account balances at different times.
