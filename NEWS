[Going to freeze initial public version on Mar 1]

The Little Extensible Accounting System (Leas) is a small program I wrote to manage my finances.  I have used it for over a year and a half daily, and I like it.  I hope it will be useful for others as well.  I have used it for a long enough period of time that I am fairly certain it "works", but I am sure there are issues to fix because only I have been using it.  Please report issues on Github!
