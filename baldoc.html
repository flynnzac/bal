<h2>1. Introduction
<a name="1. Introduction"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>bal</b> is an extensible
personal account manager, recording all the good, bad,
terrible, and mundane financial decisions you make and
helping you plan for the future. It is extensible because
its prompt is simply a Guile Scheme interpreter (where you
don&rsquo;t enclose the outer S-expression in parenthesis)
so it can execute arbitrary code on your transactions. It
has a built-in function for making Scheme functions
interactive that allows you to specify that the function
takes &quot;accounts&quot; or &quot;transactions&quot;
(which are simply Scheme lists with certain values) as
arguments and have the user select the account or
transaction from a menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main interface is a command
prompt interface using the Scheme interpreter with some
built-in C functions that can be called from Scheme, but of
course, other interfaces could be developed by running
Scheme code at the interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This document describes basic
usage of <b>bal</b> using the built-in functions and gives a
full reference manual to the functions that are available
from Scheme to aid in writing your own code to automate
whatever tasks your financial life needs automated (for
example, a script to update the value of your stock or
mutual fund holdings by fetching the latest prices from the
internet).</p>

<h2>2. Data types
<a name="2. Data types"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two data types in
<i>bal</i> of interest to programming it in Scheme: the
account and the transaction. This brief section discusses
the key concepts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Transaction and Account
Numbers.</i> Each transaction has a &quot;coordinate&quot;
given by the pair (cons account_number transaction_number).
Transactions and accounts are numbered starting at 0,
accounts are numbered in the order in which they were
created, and transactions are in chronological order by day.
Transaction number is the element number in the list
returned by <i>(bal/get-all-transactions account_name).</i>
Account number is the element number of the account in the
list returned by <i>(bal/get-all-accounts).</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Accounts in Scheme.</i> When
Scheme functions return accounts they do so as a
four-element list,</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%;"><i>(account_name account_type
number_of_transactions opening_balance)</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Transactions in Scheme.</i>
When Scheme functions return transactions they do so as a
five-element list,</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%;"><i>(description amount year
month day)</i></p>

<h2>3. Interactive functions
<a name="3. Interactive functions"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command prompt is a Scheme
interpreter except that the outer-most S expression should
not be enclosed in parenthesis to save on typing. This
section describes the &quot;interactive functions&quot;
&ndash; functions that can be entered without arguments at
the prompt and then prompt the user for options &ndash;
available in <i>bal.</i></p>

<h2>6. GNU Free Documentation License
<a name="6. GNU Free Documentation License"></a>
</h2>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em">GNU Free
Documentation License <br>
Version 1.3, 3 November 2008</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002,
2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. Everyone is
permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0. PREAMBLE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The purpose of this License is
to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful
document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure
everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or
noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
author and publisher a way to get credit for their work,
while not being considered responsible for modifications
made by others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This License is a kind of
&quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative works of
the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a
copyleft license designed for free software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We have designed this License in
order to use it for manuals for free software, because free
software needs free documentation: a free program should
come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does. But this License is not limited to software
manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of
subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
We recommend this License principally for works whose
purpose is instruction or reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. APPLICABILITY AND
DEFINITIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This License applies to any
manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to
use that work under the conditions stated herein. The
&quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or
work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring
permission under copyright law.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;Modified Version&quot;
of the Document means any work containing the Document or a
portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications
and/or translated into another language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;Secondary Section&quot;
is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the
Document&rsquo;s overall subject (or to related matters) and
contains nothing that could fall directly within that
overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of
historical connection with the subject or with related
matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or
political position regarding them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Invariant
Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
notice that says that the Document is released under this
License. If a section does not fit the above definition of
Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.
If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections
then there are none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are
certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
says that the Document is released under this License. A
Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover
Text may be at most 25 words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy
of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented
in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings)
some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to
a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters.
A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or
discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for
any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not
&quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples of suitable formats for
Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup,
Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using
a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not
generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Title Page&quot;
means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page. For works
in formats which do not have any title page as such,
&quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most
prominent appearance of the work&rsquo;s title, preceding
the beginning of the body of the text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;publisher&quot; means
any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document
to the public.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A section &quot;Entitled
XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title
either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
following text that translates XYZ in another language.
(Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned
below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
&quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or
&quot;History&quot;.) To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of
such a section when you modify the Document means that it
remains a section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this
definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Document may include
Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that
this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties:
any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may
have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this
License.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. VERBATIM COPYING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may copy and distribute the
Document in any medium, either commercially or
noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.
You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control
the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange
for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of
copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also lend copies, under
the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly
display copies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you publish printed copies
(or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of
the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document&rsquo;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you
must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the
front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both
covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the
full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible. You may add other material on the covers in
addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
other respects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the required texts for either
cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the
first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you publish or distribute
Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you
must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque
copy a computer-network location from which the general
network-using public has access to download using
public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when
you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus
accessible at the stated location until at least one year
after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly
or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
public.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is requested, but not
required, that you contact the authors of the Document well
before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. MODIFICATIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may copy and distribute a
Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of
sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
licensing distribution and modification of the Modified
Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you
must do these things in the Modified Version:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A. Use in the Title Page (and on
the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the
Document, and from those of previous versions (which should,
if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives
permission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B. List on the Title Page, as
authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for
authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than
five), unless they release you from this requirement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C. State on the Title page the
name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the
publisher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D. Preserve all the copyright
notices of the Document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E. Add an appropriate copyright
notice for your modifications adjacent to the other
copyright notices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F. Include, immediately after
the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public
permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of
this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G. Preserve in that license
notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required
Cover Texts given in the Document&rsquo;s license
notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H. Include an unaltered copy of
this License.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I. Preserve the section Entitled
&quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an
item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in
the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated
in the previous sentence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">J. Preserve the network
location, if any, given in the Document for public access to
a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot;
section. You may omit a network location for a work that was
published at least four years before the Document itself, or
if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives
permission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">K. For any section Entitled
&quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;,
Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
section all the substance and tone of each of the
contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given
therein.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L. Preserve all the Invariant
Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in
their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
considered part of the section titles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M. Delete any section Entitled
&quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may not be included
in the Modified Version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N. Do not retitle any existing
section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to
conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O. Preserve any Warranty
Disclaimers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the Modified Version includes
new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as
Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
Document, you may at your option designate some or all of
these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to
the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
Version&rsquo;s license notice. These titles must be
distinct from any other section titles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may add a section Entitled
&quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains nothing but
endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the
text has been approved by an organization as the
authoritative definition of a standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may add a passage of up to
five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25
words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover
Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by
(or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the
Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;
but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from
the previous publisher that added the old one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The author(s) and publisher(s)
of the Document do not by this License give permission to
use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
endorsement of any Modified Version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may combine the Document
with other documents released under this License, under the
terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve
all their Warranty Disclaimers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The combined work need only
contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical
Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If
there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section
unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name
of the original author or publisher of that section if
known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to
the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the
license notice of the combined work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the combination, you must
combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the
various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled
&quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections Entitled
&quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections
Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may make a collection
consisting of the Document and other documents released
under this License, and replace the individual copies of
this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow
the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
the documents in all other respects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may extract a single
document from such a collection, and distribute it
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy
of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
that document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT
WORKS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A compilation of the Document or
its derivatives with other separate and independent
documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if
the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to
limit the legal rights of the compilation&rsquo;s users
beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document
is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to
the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the Cover Text requirement of
section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document,
then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
aggregate, the Document&rsquo;s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or
the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in
electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed
covers that bracket the whole aggregate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. TRANSLATION</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Translation is considered a kind
of modification, so you may distribute translations of the
Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permission from
their copyright holders, but you may include translations of
some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original
versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in
the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that
you also include the original English version of this
License and the original versions of those notices and
disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
translation and the original version of this License or a
notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a section in the Document is
Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
&quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the
requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)
will typically require changing the actual title.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. TERMINATION</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may not copy, modify,
sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if you cease all
violation of this License, then your license from a
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the
cessation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moreover, your license from a
particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the
copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received
notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30
days after your receipt of the notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Termination of your rights under
this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who
have received copies or rights from you under this License.
If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same
material does not give you any rights to use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS
LICENSE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Free Software Foundation may
publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation
License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
to address new problems or concerns. See
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each version of the License is
given a distinguishing version number. If the Document
specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
&quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that
specified version or of any later version that has been
published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Document does not specify a version number of this
License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a
draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
this License can be used, that proxy&rsquo;s public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes
you to choose that version for the Document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11. RELICENSING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Massive Multiauthor
Collaboration Site&quot; (or &quot;MMC Site&quot;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and
also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those
works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of
such a server. A &quot;Massive Multiauthor
Collaboration&quot; (or &quot;MMC&quot;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on
the MMC site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;CC-BY-SA&quot; means the
Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license
published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San
Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions
of that license published by that same organization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Incorporate&quot; means to
publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as
part of another Document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An MMC is &quot;eligible for
relicensing&quot; if it is licensed under this License, and
if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated
in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or
invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to
November 1, 2008.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operator of an MMC Site may
republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the
same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the
MMC is eligible for relicensing.</p>
