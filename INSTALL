bal uses Autotools to build. To compile bal, type:

$ ./init_build.sh
$ ./configure
$ make

The configure script takes all the standard options (including --prefix= to decide where bal is installed).

To install:

$ sudo make install

bal depends on libreadline, libcsv, libguile, and libgc to compile.

bal expects the programs tar, mkdir, rm, and mktemp to be on the path.  It has only been tested with the GNU versions of these utilities.  Let me know if I accidently used something non-portable to BSD or similar, and I will fix it.
