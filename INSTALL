To compile bal, type:

$ make

You can install to /usr/local/ with

# make install

which just copies the bal executable to /usr/local/bin, the man page to /usr/local/share/man/man1/, and the standard Scheme function file ot /etc/bal.scm.

You can customize where to install the executable and man page with PREFIX (default: /usr/local).

BAL_SCM_INSTALL controls where the standard Scheme file is installed (default: /etc/bal.scm).

GUILEINC sets where the include directory is for guile (default: /usr/include/guile/2.2)

bal depends on libreadline, libcsv, libguile, and libgc to compile.

bal expects the programs tar, mkdir, rm, and mktemp to be on the path.  It has only been tested with the GNU versions of these utilities.  Let me know if I accidently used something non-portable to BSD or similar, and I will fix it.
