Leas uses Autotools to build. To compile Leas, type:

$ ./init_build.sh
$ ./configure
$ make

The configure script takes all the standard options (including --prefix=XX to decide where Leas is installed).

You should install the program before using it to put the Scheme file used by leas in its proper place. To install:

$ sudo make install

Leas depends on libreadline, libcsv, and libguile to compile.

Leas expects the programs tar and rm to be on the path.  It has only been tested with the GNU versions of these utilities.  Let me know if I accidently used something non-portable to BSD or similar, and I will fix it.
