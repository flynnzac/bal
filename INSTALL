To compile bal, type:

$ make

You can install to /usr/local/ with

# make install

which just copies the bal executable to /usr/local/bin and the man page to /usr/local/share/man/man1/.

bal depends on libreadline, libcsv, libguile, and libgc to compile.

bal expects the programs tar, mkdir, rm, and mktemp to be on the path.  It has only been tested with the GNU versions of these utilities.  Let me know if I accidently used something non-portable to BSD or similar, and I will fix it.
