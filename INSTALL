leas uses Autotools to build. To compile leas, type:

$ ./init_build.sh
$ ./configure
$ make

The configure script takes all the standard options (including --prefix=XX to decide where leas is installed).

To install:

$ sudo make install

leas depends on libreadline, libcsv, libguile, and libgc to compile.

leas expects the programs tar, mkdir, rm, and mktemp to be on the path.  It has only been tested with the GNU versions of these utilities.  Let me know if I accidently used something non-portable to BSD or similar, and I will fix it.
