.SH NAME
bal \- for keeping accounts in order and studying past spending habits
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bal [-f FILE] [-l CODE] [-s] [COMMAND]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bal
keeps track of personal accounts and spending.  It is extensible using Guile Scheme, a full programming language, so that it is easy to build arbitrary reports about your past transactions and to script the program to automatically add or update transactions when arbitrary conditions are met (you could, say, write a piece of Scheme code that fetches the latest stock price and updates the current value of your shares).
