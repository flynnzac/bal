<p><b>Leas</b> is an interactive, command-line program for managing personal finances.  Its goal is to be an extensible tool for helping you keep track of your spending and to aid in making plans.  I started <b>Leas</b> to keep track of my finances leading up to my wedding. I found most free software personal finance packages were large GUI programs that had a long Time-to-Enter-Transaction: it took time to boot up an application that was not usually running and enter a transaction.  This small friction made it harder for me to build the habit of keeping track of things.  I also found the programs difficult to extend. So I wrote <b>Leas</b> to solve this problem. I have been using it personally since October 2018 so it now works pretty much the way I want it to.  It has a low Time-to-Enter-Transaction because you can just enter the transaction interactively at a command prompt.  It is also easy to extend and script to automate different transactions or update the price of stocks, mutual funds, and ETF&rsquo;s. Hopefully, you will find it useful.
</p>
<p><b>Leas</b> is a command-line program, but it is possible to write a GUI on top of the program if you are looking for a project.  It is possible because <b>Leas</b> can be extended using the Guile Scheme programming language.  The program&rsquo;s prompt can execute arbitrary Scheme code. If you make a neat extension like this, let me know and I will reference it in this manual.
</p>
<p>No knowledge of Scheme or programming in general is needed to use <b>Leas</b>.  I have included almost all the functions I use personally in the distribution itself. In other words, I use it without any programming in Scheme on a day-to-day basis.  The only commands I have written that are not included in the main <b>Leas</b> distribution are some commands to fetch the price of various stocks I own and update their value automatically, but I will show how to write such a command later in this document as an example.
</p>
<p>When searching for existing Free Software solutions, I found at the other extreme programs that operated by users editing text files to add transactions (the best example being <b>ledger</b>).  I found this difficult to use and wanted something more interactive.  Of course, you may have your own preference.  Like <b>ledger</b>, <b>Leas</b> stores data in human-readable text files. <b>Leas</b>&rsquo; save files are particularly easy to analyze with statistical or spreadsheet software.  The save file is simply a <b>tar</b> archive of comma-separated data files with data about your various transactions.  You can open these files in <b>R</b> or <b>Libreoffice</b> and analyze your past spending that way.
</p>
<p>All standard <b>Leas</b> commands are small Scheme functions.  They use a built-in function <tt>leas/call</tt> which lets the user enter the function arguments interactively (it fills the role of <tt>interactive</tt> in Emacs, if you are familiar with it).  These functions are documented in the reference manual to help you construct your own commands.  The <b>Leas</b> prompt, in fact, is a Scheme interpreter.  Any Scheme expression can be written there.
</p>
<p>This document has two main sections.  In the first, I describe the basic workflow for using <b>Leas</b>.  This section is more in-depth than the manpage and gives some examples of how to add accounts and make transactions.  It is a tutorial that will help get you up-and-running using <b>Leas</b>.  In the second section, I describe all the Scheme commands exported by <b>Leas</b> which is more useful if you are trying to write your own functions.
