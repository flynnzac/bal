  <h1>The bal website</h1>

  <p>
    <b>bal</b> is an extensible, commandline tool to manage personal finances and accounts. Its command prompt allows you to add transactions and keep track of your current and future account balances.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The program is highly extensible because the <b>bal</b> command prompt is actually a Scheme interpreter so it can execute arbitrary code and operate on transactions and accounts.  <b>bal</b> also include facilities for making Scheme functions interactive using the Scheme function <i>(bal/call)</i> (which plays a similar role as <i>(interactive)</i> in Emacs, if you are familiar with it).
  </p>
