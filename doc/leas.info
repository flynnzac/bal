1 Introduction
**************

leas is an interactive, command-line program for managing personal
finances.  Its goal is to be a simple but easily-extensible tool for
helping you keep track of your spending and an aid in making future
plans.  leas was conceived from the need to track my own personal
finances leading up to my wedding and finding that most free software
personal finance packages were large, complicated GUI programs that were
difficult to hack to make work the way I wanted them to.  I have been
using leas for my personal account management since October 2018 and
have it found it useful for keeping track of things.  Hopefully, you
will find it useful too!

   leas is a command-line program, but it is possible to write a GUI on
top of the program.  It is possible because leas can be extended
arbitrarily using the Guile Scheme programming language.  If you make a
neat extension like this, let me know and I will reference it in this
manual.

   No knowledge of Scheme or programming in general is required to use
leas.  I have included almost all the functions I use personally in the
leas distribution itself.  In other words, I use leas without any
programming in Scheme on a day-to-day basis.  The only commands I have
written that are not included in the main leas distribution are some
commands to fetch the price of various stocks I own and update their
value automatically, but I will show how to write such a command later
in this document as an example.

   The other extreme in the accounting software world were programs that
required the user to edit text files to add transactions (the best
example being ledger).  I found this to be difficult to use as a user
and wanted something more interactive.  Of course, you may have your own
preference.  Like ledger, leas stores data in human-readable text files.
leas's save files are particularly easy to analyze with statistical
software, like R or Libreoffice.  The leas save file is simply a tar
archive of comma-separated data files with data about your various
transactions.  You can open these files in R, for example, and analyze
your past spending that way.

   All commands that ship with leas are small Guile Scheme commands
which call a few functions exported by leas from C and a built-in
function leas/call which lets the user enter the function arguments
interactively (it fills the role of interactive in Emacs, if you are
familiar with it).  These functions are documented in the reference
manual to help you construct your own commands.  The leas prompt, in
fact, is a Scheme interpreter.  Any Scheme expression can be written
there.

   This document has two main sections.  In the first, I describe the
basic workflow for using leas.  This section is more in-depth than the
manpage and gives some examples of how to add accounts and make
transactions.  It is a tutorial that will help get you up-and-running
using leas.  In the second section, I describe all the Scheme commands
exported by leas which is more useful if you are trying to write your
own commands.

2.1 Adding a cash asset account
===============================

A leas file is made up of several "accounts".  To start using leas, you
will want to add some asset accounts.  Assets can be wherever you store
your money.  Asset accounts can be Checking accounts, Savings accounts,
Stocks, Bonds, Cash, and anything else you own.  To see how this works
in leas, let's look at an example of adding a checking account to a
fresh leas file.

     :> aa
     Account: Checking
     0: Expense
     1: Income
     2: Asset
     3: Liability
     Type: 2
     Opening Balance: 10000
     (Checking) :>

   This opens up an asset account called "Checking" with 10000 units of
currency in it as an opening balance.  We can use asset accounts to pay
for our expenses, to pay back our loans, and as a place to store the
income we earn from working.  I discuss how to do each of those things
in the following sections.


File: leas.info,  Node: Paying for expenses,  Next: Earning income,  Prev: Adding a cash asset account,  Up: Tutorial

2.2 Paying for expenses
=======================

Now that we have an asset account, we can use it to pay for our
expenses.

   First, we add an expense account, say an account for our Rent.

     (Checking) :> aa
     Account: Rent
     0: Expense
     1: Income
     2: Asset
     3: Liability
     Type: 0
     Opening Balance: 0
     (Rent) :>

   Now, to pay the Rent.  The main command you use in leas after getting
your accounts set up is the "transfer" command, t.  t transfers money
from one account to another account.  Making a payment is transferring
money from your asset accounts to your expense accounts.

     (Rent) :> t
      0: Checking
      1: Rent
     To Account: 1
      0: Checking
      1: Rent
     From Account: 0
     Amount: 2000
     Description: The rent
     Day:
     Year [2019]:
     Month [4]:
     Day [30]:
     (Checking) :>

   By default, the prompt tells you what the current account is and,
when you add an account, the current account is set to the account you
just created.  leas has several commands that act on the current
account.  You can change the current account with the sa ("switch
account") command,

     (Checking) :> sa
      0: Checking
      1: Rent
     Account: 1
     (Rent) :>

   Another command you commonly use in leas is the "list transactions"
command, lt.  lt lists the transactions in the current account,

     (Rent) :> lt
     2019-04-30 The rent        2000.00

   To see how much money is in your accounts, type la (for "list
account").

     (Rent) :> la
     Checking         8000.00    8000.00
     Rent             2000.00    2000.00

   The output has two columns.  The first gives the balance in your
account on the current day, and the second gives the balance in your
account in the future.

   To see the current day, use the command cd.  To set the current day,
use sd.

     (Rent) :> sd
     Current Day:
     Year [2019]: 2018
     Month [4]: 12
     Day [30]: 31
     (Rent) :> cd
     2018-12-31

   Now, if we type la, we can see what the account balance would have
looked like on 2018-12-31 and what it would be in the future.

     (Rent) :> la
     Checking        10000.00    8000.00
     Rent                0.00    2000.00

   To change the day back to the current day, type sd and take all the
default options,

     (Rent) :> sd
     Current Day:
     Year [2019]:
     Month [4]:
     Day [30]:
     (Rent) :>

   To list only expense accounts (useful for getting an understanding of
where you are spending your money),

     (Rent) :> lae
     Rent         2000.00    2000.00


File: leas.info,  Node: Earning income,  Next: Managing debt,  Prev: Paying for expenses,  Up: Tutorial

2.3 Earning income
==================

It is a good idea to earn income to pay for your expenses.  Highly
recommended.  Like with paying expenses, to add income start by adding
an income account.  Let's start with adding a salary account,

     (Rent) :> aa
     Account: Salary
     0: Expense
     1: Income
     2: Asset
     3: Liability
     Type: 1
     Opening Balance: 0
     (Salary) :>

   To receive a salary, do the opposite of paying for expenses: transfer
money from the salary account to an asset account.
     (Salary) :> t
      0: Checking
      1: Rent
      2: Salary
     To Account: 0
      0: Checking
      1: Rent
      2: Salary
     From Account: 2
     Amount: 6000
     Description: Salary
     Day:
     Year [2019]:
     Month [4]:
     Day [30]:
     (Salary) :> lt
     2019-04-30 Salary        -6000.00
     (Salary) :> la
     Checking        14000.00   14000.00
     Rent             2000.00    2000.00
     Salary          -6000.00   -6000.00


File: leas.info,  Node: Managing debt,  Next: Non-cash assets,  Prev: Earning income,  Up: Tutorial

2.4 Managing debt
=================

Adding debt follows the same pattern as paying expenses and receiving
income.
     (Salary) :> aa
     Account: Loan
     0: Expense
     1: Income
     2: Asset
     3: Liability
     Type: 3
     Opening Balance: 0
     (Loan) :> t
      0: Checking
      1: Rent
      2: Salary
      3: Loan
     To Account: 0
      0: Checking
      1: Rent
      2: Salary
      3: Loan
     From Account: 3
     Amount: 10000
     Description: Personal Loan
     Day:
     Year [2019]:
     Month [4]:
     Day [30]:
     (Loan) :> la
     Checking        24000.00   24000.00
     Rent             2000.00    2000.00
     Salary          -6000.00   -6000.00
     Loan           -10000.00  -10000.00
     (Loan) :> lt
     2019-04-30 Personal Loan       -10000.00

   Usually, people do not give you interest-free loans.  So you will
also need an expense account for paying interest.
     (Loan) :> aa
     Account: Interest
     0: Expense
     1: Income
     2: Asset
     3: Liability
     Type: 0
     Opening Balance: 0
     (Interest) :>

   To pay back loans, use the command pl.  This command allows you to
split your payment on the loan between interest and principal.
     (Interest) :> pl
      0: Checking
      1: Rent
      2: Salary
      3: Loan
      4: Interest
     Loan Account: 3
      0: Checking
      1: Rent
      2: Salary
      3: Loan
      4: Interest
     Interest Account: 4
      0: Checking
      1: Rent
      2: Salary
      3: Loan
      4: Interest
     Pay from Account: 0
     Principal: 70
     Interest: 30
     Description: Loan Payment
     Day:
     Year [2019]:
     Month [4]:
     Day [30]:
     (Checking) :> la
     Checking        23900.00   23900.00
     Rent             2000.00    2000.00
     Salary          -6000.00   -6000.00
     Loan            -9930.00   -9930.00
     Interest           30.00      30.00

   It is useful to see broadly how much we are spending, how much we are
making, and how in debt we are.  To do so, we can use the command bt.
     (Checking) :> bt
     Expense           2030.00    2030.00
     Income           -6000.00   -6000.00
     Asset            23900.00   23900.00
     Liability        -9930.00   -9930.00
     Worth            13970.00   13970.00
     Balances         10000.00

   Note that income is measured as a negative number as are liabilities.
Worth is Assets - Liabilities.  Balances gives the total of the opening
balances.

2.5 Non-cash assets
===================

You may own some non-cash assets, like stocks, mutual funds, or bonds.
The value of these assets in terms of currency changes over time.  leas
provides a command for updating the currency value of these assets.

   First, let's add our mutual fund,
     (Checking) :> aa
     Account: Mutual Fund
     0: Expense
     1: Income
     2: Asset
     3: Liability
     Type: 2
     Opening Balance: 10000
     (Mutual Fund) :>

   Then, let's add an income account for our fund.
     (Mutual Fund) :> aa
     Account: Mutual Fund Income
     0: Expense
     1: Income
     2: Asset
     3: Liability
     Type: 1
     Opening Balance: 0
     (Mutual Fund Income) :>

   Now, say we own 500 shares of the mutual fund each worth 20 currency
units.  Say the value of a share in the mutual fund increased to 21
currency units.  We can then use the csp ("change share price") command
to change the value of the shares in our mutual fund,
     (Mutual Fund Income) :> sa
      0: Checking
      1: Rent
      2: Salary
      3: Loan
      4: Interest
      5: Mutual Fund
      6: Mutual Fund Income
     Account: 5
     (Mutual Fund) :> csp
      0: Checking
      1: Rent
      2: Salary
      3: Loan
      4: Interest
      5: Mutual Fund
      6: Mutual Fund Income
     From Account: 6
     Stock Price: 21
     Number of Shares: 500
     Day:
     Year [2019]:
     Month [4]:
     Day [30]:
     (Mutual Fund Income) :> lt
     2019-04-30 Stock Price Change         -500.00
     (Mutual Fund Income) :> la
     Checking                  23900.00   23900.00
     Rent                       2000.00    2000.00
     Salary                    -6000.00   -6000.00
     Loan                      -9930.00   -9930.00
     Interest                     30.00      30.00
     Mutual Fund               10500.00   10500.00
     Mutual Fund Income         -500.00    -500.00
     (Mutual Fund Income) :>

2.6 Saving, loading, and quitting
=================================

To save your leas accounts, use the w command.

     (Mutual Fund Income) :> w
     File: example.leas
     (Mutual Fund Income) :>

   To do so non-interactively, type leas/write "example.leas".

   To quit leas, use the q command,

     (Mutual Fund Income) :> q
     Save file? (y/n) n

   To load the file you just saved, you can use the interactive command
r,

     $ leas
     :> r
     File: example.leas
     (Checking) :> la
     Checking                  23900.00   23900.00
     Rent                       2000.00    2000.00
     Salary                    -6000.00   -6000.00
     Loan                      -9930.00   -9930.00
     Interest                     30.00      30.00
     Mutual Fund               10500.00   10500.00
     Mutual Fund Income         -500.00    -500.00
     (Checking) :>

   To load the file non-interactively, you can use the command leas/read
"example.leas".  This command is particularly useful to include in
leas's init file ~/.leasrc.scm.  Usually, this file will include the
line,

     (leas/read "leasfile.leas")


File: leas.info,  Node: Scheme code,  Next: Common customizations,  Prev: Saving loading and quitting,  Up: Tutorial

2.7 Scheme code
===============

The prompt is a Scheme interpreter and can execute arbitrary code.  The
only difference is that the outer expression should not be enclosed in
parenthesis.  For example,
     (Checking) :> display (string-append (number->string (+ 1 2)) "\n")
     3
     (Checking) :>

   leas provides a useful function p for displaying expressions and then
adding a newline like the above,
     (Checking) :> p (+ 1 2)
     3
     (Checking) :>

   In interactive functions, the prompt for the various arguments allows
Scheme expressions as well.  For example, you can enter the value of a
transaction as (- 15.29 13.99).

2.8 Common customizations
=========================

You can add customizations that are loaded automatically in
~/.leasrc.scm.  This section gives examples for a few common
customizations.

* Menu:

* Set default file::
* Customize prompt::


File: leas.info,  Node: Set default file,  Next: Customize prompt,  Up: Common customizations

2.8.1 Set default file
----------------------

You will probably want to load the same file almost everytime you load
leas.  To do so, add the following to ~/.leasrc.scm:

     (leas/read "/path/to/file/myfinances.leas")


File: leas.info,  Node: Customize prompt,  Prev: Set default file,  Up: Common customizations

2.8.2 Customize prompt
----------------------

The leas prompt is generated by calling the Scheme function
(leas/prompt).  If you change this function, you can customize the
prompt.  For example, try adding the following to see the current date,

     (define leas/prompt
       (lambda ()
         (if (= (leas/get-number-of-accounts) 0)
             ":> "
             (let* ((day (leas/get-current-day))
                    (mday (list-ref day 0))
                    (month (list-ref day 1))
                    (year (list-ref day 2)))
               (string-append
                "("
                (leas/get-current-account)
                " "
                (number->string year)
                "-"
                (number->string month)
                "-"
                (number->string mday)
                ") :> ")))))

3 Leas file format
******************

The leas save file is a tar archive containing the following files in a
directory named after the save file's filename (e.g.  a save file named
book.leas would, when un-tarred, be a directory called book):

   * accounts - a CSV file containing the metadata for each account, one
     line for each account.  There is no header line giving column
     names.  The fields are (in this order):
        * Account Type - one of expense, income, asset, liability.
        * Account Name - the name of the account
        * Opening Balance - the opening balance of the account.
   * account_name.csv - for each account, there is a separate CSV file
     (the format of the filename for this CSV file implies that account
     names in leas need to be valid filenames).  There is no header line
     giving column names.  Each row in the file is a transaction.  The
     fields are (in this order):
        * Account Name - will be the same for all transactions in the
          file, just the account name.
        * Amount - the amount of money added to or subtracted from the
          account.
        * Day - the day of the transaction (YYYY-MM-DD)
        * Description - a description of the transaction
