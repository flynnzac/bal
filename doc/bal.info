1 Introduction
**************

bal is an interactive, command-line program for managing personal
finances.  Its goal is to be a simple but easily-extensible tool for
helping you keep track of your spending and an aid in making future
plans.  bal was conceived from the need to track my own personal
finances leading up to my wedding and finding that most free software
personal finance packages were large, complicated GUI programs that were
difficult to hack to make work the way I wanted them to.  bal is a
command-line program, but it is possible to write a GUI on top of the
program.  It is possible because bal can be extended arbitrarily using
the Guile Scheme programming language.  If you make a neat extension
like this, let me know and I will reference it in this manual.

   No knowledge of Scheme or programming in general is required to use
bal.  I have included almost all the functions I use personally in the
bal distribution itself.  In other words, I use bal without any
programming in Scheme on a day-to-day basis.  The only commands I have
written that are not included in the main bal distribution are some
commands to fetch the price of various stocks I own and update their
value automatically, but I will show how to write such a command later
in this document as an example.

   The other extreme in the accounting software world were programs that
required the user to edit text files to add transactions (the best
example being ledger).  I found this to be difficult to use as a user
and wanted something more interactive.  Of course, you may have your own
preference.  Like ledger, bal stores data in human-readable text files,
but bal's save files are particularly easy to analyze with other tools.
The bal save file is simply a tar archive of comma-separated data files
with data about your various transactions.  You can open these files in
R, for example, and analyze your past spending that way.

   All commands that ship with bal are small Guile Scheme commands which
call a few functions exported by bal from C. These functions as well as
the built-in interactive functions are documented in the reference
manual to help you construct your own commands.  The bal prompt, in
fact, is a Scheme interpreter.  Any Scheme expression can be written
there.

   This document has two main sections.  In the first, I describe the
basic workflow for using bal.  This section is more in-depth than the
manpage and gives some examples of how to add accounts and make
transactions.  It is a tutorial that will help get you up-and-running
using bal.  In the second section, I describe all the Scheme commands
exported by bal which is more useful if you are trying to write your own
commands.
